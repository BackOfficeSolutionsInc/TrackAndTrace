Thanks! Hope your christmas and new years went well. Sorry to get back to you so late, I'm rarely in Linkedin.

I'm happy to answer any questions you have about Traction Tools. Here's an overview to get you started.
Traction Tools builds software for organizations implementing a business scaffolding known as the Entrepreneurial Operating System.
EOS helps small and medium sized companies that have plateaued achieve growth again.
EOS is outlined in a book called Traction by Gino Wickman. In it he outlines 25 paper-based tools for improving everything from weekly meetings 
to quarterly reviews. My company automates these tools and sells them to organizations implementing EOS. 
We eliminate the paper and the redundancy that comes with it to help our clients gain traction faster.
