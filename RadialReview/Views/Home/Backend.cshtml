                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Your name and profile image are an important way for you to ensure you are accurately reviewed. You can edit your profile image by clicking 
                        <a href="@Url.Action("Manage","Account")">here.</a>
                    </p>
                    if (ViewBag.IsManager && false)
                    {
                        <h3>Instructions for management:</h3>
                        <p>
                            As a supervisor you can manage the organization from the 'Manage' tab, or by clicking <a href="@Url.Action("Index","Manage")">here</a>.
                            From the manage menu, you can add subordinates, job descriptions, questions, and teams for the organization.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A company should have a set of goals that govern the actions of it's employees.
                            Before reviews can be issued, you and your employees should construct a set of personal goals that align with your company's goals.
                            A set of questions should be generated that gauge how well the employee is meeting their goals.
                            The employee's co-workers will review the employee on these questions.
                            There are four levels of granularity for questions:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Organization-wide</li>
                                <li>Team</li>
                                <li>Position</li>
                                <li>Individual</li>
                            </ul>
                            Every user reviewing the employee will rate the person on how well they are meeting their responsibilities.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Once all the questions are in place, you can issue a review and specify a due date.
                            An e-mail will be sent to employees to let them know that they have a task to complete.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After everyone's reviews are complete, you can view the results and create a report in the
                            <a href="@Url.Action("Index","Reports")">Reports</a> tab. Reports consist of charts and anonymous feedback, 
                            as well as historical changes. You can autorize your employees to view the report once they are authorized.
                        </p>
