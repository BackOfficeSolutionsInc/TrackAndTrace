	*  Rock sheet for the quarterly to include the measurables at the top so that the measurables print from the V/TO.
	*  When the V/TO is printed (I've noticed this a few times now), the second Traction page is getting cut off at the top. The second page will just print the headings across the top and none of the content. 
	*  Please adjust the copyright date at the bottom of the V/TO to go to 2016.
